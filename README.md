## üöÄ Project Overview 

**TaskHive** is a full-stack micro-task and earning platform designed to connect Workers and Buyers. The platform allows Workers to complete small tasks and earn money, while Buyers can post tasks and request workers. TaskHive incorporates a coin-based payment system, payment gateway integration via **Stripe**, role-based access control, and real-time notifications to ensure a smooth user experience.

With three key roles‚ÄîWorker, Buyer, and Admin‚ÄîTaskHive offers a dynamic and user-friendly environment. Workers can submit their work, request withdrawals, and view available tasks, while Buyers can create tasks, manage their listings, and purchase coins for payments. Admins have a full overview of the platform, with the ability to manage users, tasks, and the overall platform operations.
